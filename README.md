Unveiling Boasting Behaviour on Social-Media: A Comprehensive Analysis Using Transformer-Based Models
# Introduction
Boasting refers to being excessively proud and self-satisfied
talking about one’s achievements, possessions, or abilities”
. They frequently brag about their accomplishments and
portray their joyful lives to others. People are attracted to
feeling unique and distinct from others. Social media platforms
play a significant role in self-promotion in the current digital
era. It has both positive and negative aspects. People
love constructing a positive social image and expressing
their positive qualities. Sharing accomplishments and joyful
moments boosts self-esteem and pride. However, boasting
can have negative consequences. Occasionally, individuals
express themselves excessively to satisfy their egos. This
excessive boasting may come across as conceited, leading
to negative on the part of others. To gain a deeper
understanding of people’s thoughts and reactions on social
media, it would be advantageous to identify and classify
these posts by analyzing their keywords.

# DATASET DESCRIPTION
The dataset for our study is publicly available in online
and widely used in related tasks for research [11]. The
dataset includes approximately 6,697 tweets with hashtags
and multi-word queries with five attributes id, text, sampling,
round, and label. Here, the boasting class has 781 tweets and
the not boasting class has 5915 tweets.

# METHODOLOGY
We preprocess our imbalanced data and tokenize it for
better performance in our model. We analyze different types
of classical transformer-based models for classifying boasting
in social media.
A. Text Preprocessing #
B. Tokenization
C. Proposed Models
D. Binary Classification

# Conclusion
we have a comparison of models where RoBERTa
has performed the best among the three having the highest
accuracy 0.91 and compared to BERT and DistilBERT it also
has high Recall and F1-Score making a significantly better
performance.
